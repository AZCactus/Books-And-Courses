/*

Constructor Pattern:

Pros:
    - Most common, used everywhere
    - Like Java, C++ (familiar)
    - Allows constructs like private variables

Prototype Pattern:

Pros: 
    - Easy to understand (not a lot of moving parts)
    - Feels more natural to JavaScript specifically

Really important to know both patterns!!!
