// Classical inheritance: the methods of OO used in older languages such as Java and C++
//  - class: architectural diagram
//  - instance: house made to the specifications of that architectural diagram

// Prototypal inheritance: new objects are created from existing objects
//  - new objects are created from existing objects
//  - Basically, we do not create a new house, we just create a house based on an existing house!

// Also: Pseudo-Classical Pattern / Constructor Pattern
