/*

First, what is Cordova?
    - It is the core tooling that allows us to build hybrid applications using web technologies

Ionic
-----

1) HTML for the various mobile UI components that we've come to expect such as...
    - Tabbed interfaces
    - Side menus
    - Toggle buttons
    - Side interfaces

2) JS framework that allows us to work with components and add our business logic

3) It will detect which device it is being run on and provide OS specific styling for your app

Comes with:
    - 'Ionic Push' for push notifications
    - 'Ionic Deploy' so that you can update your apps after they have been installed by a user
        - This is a HUGE advantage that Ionic has over its native counterparts
            - Now, to update your app, no manual user interaction is required
    - 'Ionic Analytics' - yeah
    - 'Ionic Package' - building in the cloud
        - Will no longer need a Mac to developer iOS apps
