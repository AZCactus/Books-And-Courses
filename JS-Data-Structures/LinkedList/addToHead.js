// ADD A NODE TO THE HEAD OF THE LL

// this.head: refers to the old HEAD of the LL that we want to replace
// prev: null, because no nodes come before the HEAD node

// - if it isn't empty, we need to make sure we connect our new HEAD node to all of the other nodes correctly - we will do this by making sure the PREVIOUS and NEXT pointers of the old and new HEAD node are pointing where they should be pointing

// - if the LL is empty, then adding to the head is as simple as creating a new node and pointing the HEAD and TAIL pointers both at this new node.
