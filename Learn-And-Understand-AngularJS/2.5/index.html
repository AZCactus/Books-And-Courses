<!--NOTE: Model, View, Whatever

AngularJS is "Model, View, Whatever"

Model: Thing that defines our data. E.G. JavaScript
View: Thing that people see and interact with. E.G. HTML
Whatever: Something that binds that model and the view.
    - This means that whatever happens in the model happens in the view, and vice versa.

Hence, many call AngularJS "MV*"
