__Remember that Redux serves to construct the app state and React provides the views to display that state__

_Our application state is generated by reducer functions_

* The books reducer always returns an array of books
 - The array contains a list of objects where each object returns one book
* We added the books reducer to the "combineReducers" call inside of index.js in the reducers folder
* The reducer is going to add a key to the global app state called "books" where the key is books and the value is whatever gets returned from the BooksReducer

* Next, we created the BookList component
  - We decided to promote the component to a container because it needed to be aware of the Redux state
* Promoted it to a container by...
  - Importing the "connect" function from 'react-redux' then
  - Defining mapStateToProps and hooking it together using the connect function
* We chose the BookList component to connect the redux store because only BookList cares about the list of books
  - The app doesn't care or need to know about the list of books at all
* We made sure that app.js actually rendered the BookList
* We then launched it in the browser and saw the code in action

__Redux generated a state object that contained our books then mapped that state as props to our component__
_Because the state was updated (through the reducer) the component re-rendered with that list of books_

*** A container is a normal React component that gets bonded to the application state ***
*** Whenever our app state changes, the container will re-render as well ***
