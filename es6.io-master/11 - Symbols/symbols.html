  // *** You should reach for a Symbol when you want the keys in your object to be absolutely unique ***

  // a seventh primitive type has been added to JS: Symbol
  // symbols are unique identifiers that help us avoid naming collisions
  const wes = Symbol('Wes'); // the string is a descriptor
  const person = Symbol('Wes'); 
  // are these the same then?
  console.log(wes === person) // false
  console.log(wes == person) // false
  // nope! not equal at all!

    [Symbol('Mark')] : { grade: 50, gender: 'male' },
    [Symbol('olivia')]: { grade: 80, gender: 'female' },
    [Symbol('olivia')]: { grade: 80, gender: 'female' },
  }; // having two olivias could cause issues. we could use a unique identifier but making Symbols is easier
  
  // *** Symbols are not enumerable *** - so this may be a good way to store private data
  for (const person in classRoom) {
    console.log(person);
  }

  // if you want to enumerate, you can use 'getOwnPropertySymbols' to turn them into an array
  const syms = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(classRoom);
  // but if we look in the browser, we can only see entries like '1: Symbol(olivia)' so how do we get the data out of them?
  const data = syms.map(sym => classRoom[sym]);
  // by using the symbol as the property key, you can extract the data
  console.log(data);
